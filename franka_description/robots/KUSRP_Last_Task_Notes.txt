In the gazebo picking part is quite complex. The physics engine simulation is not precise enough to simulate a real pick most of the times.
Because of that we are going to do a little trick. Move the gripper to the target position and create a virtual fixed joint between the object the gripper. 
This way when the gripper moves it will move together with the object.

Install the required package with git clone.
If git is not installed on your machine install it using "sudo apt install git"
